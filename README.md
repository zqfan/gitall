# gitall
clone/pull all repositories of a specified orgnization

There is a repo: [https://github.com/muhasturk/gitim](https://github.com/muhasturk/gitim) does same work but cannot work for now, because it depens on [https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) which breaks for latest Github API. So here is the new wheel :P

# TODO
